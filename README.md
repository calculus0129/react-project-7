From Section 20 - Advanced Redux

We Learned about putting side-effect and asynchronous codes with redux.

- sync, side-effect free code: avoid action creators or long components. Prefer reducers!
- async or side-effect code: the opposite. (“never“ use reducers)
- component, action creator implementation and concepts and Redux DevTools!

I am ready to use Redux in any kind of Application that I may be building with any kind of logic I have in this application including side-effects, HTTP requests, or async code!
